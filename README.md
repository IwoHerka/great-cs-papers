## Collection of great papers on functional programming and software-engineering


### An Axiomatic Basis for Computer Programming - C. A. R. Hoare - 1969

_Abstract_: In this paper an attempt is made to explore the logical 
foundations of computer programming by use of techniques which were first 
applied in the study of geometry and have later been extended to other 
branches of mathematics. This involves the elucidation of sets of axioms
and rules of inference which can be used in proofs of the properties of 
computer programs. Examples are given of such axioms and rules, and a formal
proof of a simple theorem is displayed. Finally, it is argued that important
advantage, both theoretical and practical, may follow from a pursuance of
these topics.

### Why Functional Programming Matters - J. Hughes - 1989/1990

_Abstract_: As software becomes more and more complex, it is more and more
important to structure it well. Well-structured software is easy to write
and to debug, and provides a collection of modules that can be reused
to reduce future programming costs. In this paper we show that two features
of functional languages in particular, higher-order functions and lazy
evaluation, can contribute significantly to modularity. As examples, we
manipulate lists and trees, program several numerical algorithms, and implement
the alpha-beta heuristic (an algorithm from Artificial Intelligence
used in game-playing programs). We conclude that since modularity is the
key to successful programming, functional programming offers important
advantages for software development.
